Yeah! First post on my new blog. I used to blog at [log.logfish.net](http://log.logfish.net/), but that runs on [Drupal](http://drupal.org/). Drupal does not really allow for offline blogging and with this new blog: static page generation has come to the rescue!

Now, my blog is statically generated! More on that later. For now: __FIRST POST__!
